# JustDMS
An open source implementation of a standard Document Management System (DMS) used in public administration or private firms for the normal end users that need the same idea for there own private documents. 
My focus therefore is on usability, sync features (google drive, nextcloud  ...) and drawing feature for convertibles.

This is mainly a learning project for concepts I learned in university about software development and engineering. 
If you have experience with C# development or software design and want to help feel free to open a issue or send me a message to let me know what i can improve. 
Or if you have input from the user sight like what features you want to see or need for you to use it just make a feature request.
