# justdms
An open source implementation of a standard Document Management System (DMS) used in public administration or private firms for the normal end users that need the same idea for there own private documents. My focus therefore is on usability, sync features (google drive, nextcloud  ...) and drawing feature for convertibles.

Planned:
- desktop app (Linux, Windows)
- Sync feature (local - cloud)
- annotations and drawing
- Avalonia UI GUI
- Drag and Drop for all common file types a user can have
- Indexing for fast search and word search in files

Not planned nor aimed for:
- Replacing enterprise DMS products
- Complex compliance / legal archiving features out of the box
- Full-blown multi-tenant SaaS

This is mainly a learning project for concepts I learned in university about software development and engineering. If you have  expirience with C# development or software design and want to help feel free to open a issue or send me a message to let me know what i can improve.
